<h1>Project Analysis</h1>
<p>This is the 3D model I made for an idea of a flashlight. This flashlight
is designed for kids, which tend to have some educational use. There are different
sound effects and different colours of lights. In addition, there are numerous buttons
that could be interacted, such as the eyebrows, the wings, the feet and the main
button on the handle. I did some research for user experience for this project
and I found it is good to use plastic or ruber for this flashlight.</p>
