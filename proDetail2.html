<h1>Project Analysis</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>CallEasy is an App designed by me. The app is for providing a more convenient
life experience for deaf-mute people.</p>

<h3>Audiences</h3>
<p>There are two groups of users for my App,
deaf-mute users and signlanguage interpreters. By providing a online thrid-party
platform, deaf-mute users and sign language interpreters could be set up by appointment
and have a interpreting service online.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>CallEasy aims on providing deaf-mute people with a better communication environment.
CallEasy could provide interpreting services without the limitation of time, distances,
language and price. Deaf-mute users would have more privacy than have an interpreter face to
face. By using CallEasy, the descrimination would decrease since the companies
and communities would feel easier to provide sign-language interpreting services and
therefore, provide more opportunities for deaf-mute people to get into the society
and live a better life.</p>

<h3>Iteration</h3>
<p>The color scheme for this app aims on having a delightful working and using experience.
Since CallEasy is a functional application, I used blue and green to satisfy both of
delightful and professional.</p>

<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
<p>Since CallEasy is a functional app, designers do need to think about the </p>
function first rather that visual design. CallEasy is designed for
deaf-mute people, therefore, I tried not to make the words offensive. Moreover, CallEasy requires
payment so the privacy of users' information is also important. The main function of
CallEasy is text and video call, which would work for both deaf-mute users and interpreters.
